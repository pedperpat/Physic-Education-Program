Acceleration: Is the rate of change of velocity of an object. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting 
		on the object, as described by Newton's Second Law.The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second 
		squared (m s-2). Accelerations are vector quantities (they have magnitude and direction) and add 
		according to the parallelogram law. As a vector, the calculated net force is equal to the product of 
		the object's mass (a scalar quantity) and its acceleration.

Center of mass: Is the unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero or the point where
		if a force is applied causes it to move in direction of force without rotation. The distribution of mass is 
		balanced around the center of mass and the average of the weighted position coordinates of the distributed 
		mass defines its coordinates. Calculations in mechanics are often simplified when formulated with respect to
		 the center of mass.

Force: Can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. 
		Force can also be described by intuitive concepts such as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and 
		direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.

Mass: It is generally a measure of an object's resistance to changing its state of motion when a force is applied. It is determined by 
		the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies, its resistance to acceleration or directional 
		changes, and in the theory of relativity gives the mass–energy content of a system. The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).
